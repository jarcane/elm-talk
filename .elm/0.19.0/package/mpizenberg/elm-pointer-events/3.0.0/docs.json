[{"name":"Html.Events.Extra.Drag","comment":" [HTML5 drag events][dragevent] is a quite complicated specification.\nMostly because it is very stateful, and many properties and functions\nonly make sense in one situation and not the rest.\nFor example, the `effectAllowed` property can only be set successfully\nin a `dragstart` event, and setting it in another will be ignored.\nAnother example, the `dragend` should be attached to the object dragged,\nwhile the `dragleave` should be attached to potential drop target.\nOne more, the `dragover` event listener is required on a drop target.\nOtherwise the drop event will be cancelled.\n\nConsequently, I've chosen to present a slightly opinionated API for drag events,\nmitigating most of potential errors.\nIn case it prevents you from using it, please report your use case in\n[an issue][issues]. I hope by also providing the decoders,\nthe library can still help you setup your own event listeners.\n\nThere seems to be two main use cases for drag events:\n\n1.  Dropping files from the OS as resources to load.\n2.  Drag and dropping DOM elements in page.\n\nThe rest of the documentation presents the API with those use cases in mind.\n\n[dragevent]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DragEvent\n[issues]: https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-pointer-events/issues\n\n\n# The Event Type\n\n@docs Event, DataTransfer, File\n\n\n# File Dropping\n\n@docs onFileFromOS, FileDropConfig\n\n\n# Drag and Drop\n\nI encourage you to read [this blog post][disaster] before you take the decision\nto use HTML5 drag and drop API instead of your own custom solution.\n\n[disaster]: https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html\n\n\n## Managing the Dragged Item\n\n@docs onSourceDrag, DraggedSourceConfig, EffectAllowed, startPortData, effectAllowedToString\n\n\n## Managing a Drop Target\n\n@docs onDropTarget, DropTargetConfig, DropEffect, overPortData, dropEffectToString\n\n\n# Decoders for Advanced Usage\n\n@docs eventDecoder, dataTransferDecoder, fileListDecoder, fileDecoder\n\n","unions":[{"name":"DropEffect","comment":" Drop effect as configured by the drop target.\nThis will change the visual aspect of the mouse icon.\n\nIf the drop target sets (via port on `dragover`) a drop effect\nincompatible with the effects allowed for the dragged item,\nthe drop will not happen.\n\n","args":[],"cases":[["NoDropEffect",[]],["MoveOnDrop",[]],["CopyOnDrop",[]],["LinkOnDrop",[]]]}],"aliases":[{"name":"DataTransfer","comment":" Hold the data being dragged during a drag and drop operation.\nThis corresponds to JavaScript [DataTransfer].\n\nThe `files` attribute holds the list of files being dragged.\n\nThe `types` attribute contains a list of strings providing\nthe different formats of objects being dragged.\n\nThe `dropEffect` attribute provides feedback on the selected effect\nfor the current drag and drop operation.
