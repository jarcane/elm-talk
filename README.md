Elm-talk
=================

This is a simple framework for slide presentations in Elm.

Slides are written in Markdown, contained within `slides.md`. Each slide is divided by the glyph `^^^^`. HTML embedding is supported, and it uses the `smartpants` option.

Navigation is controlled by the keyboard arrow keys: left for previous, right for next.

Developed for my talk "I used Elm in production and it cost me my job" at SmallFP 2018 in Helsinki.
