Elm-talk
=================

This is a simple framework for slide presentations in Elm.

Slides are written in Markdown, contained within `slides.md`. Each slide is divided by the glyph `^^^^`. HTML embedding is supported, and it uses the `smartpants` option.

Navigation is controlled by the keyboard arrow keys: left for previous, right for next.

Developed for my talk "I used Elm in production and it cost me my job" at SmallFP 2018 in Helsinki. You can watch this talk on video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFrKffrKCeU&index=5&list=PLetHPRQvX4a9DR7W75YxiCwD7T1q2QETf&t=0s
